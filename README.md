# Liftkeeper Homework Documentation

## üöÄ Overview

A Frontend application that manages, simulates a Lotto game, as a Player or Operator, choose your role. The frontend is developed using React + Vite with JavaScript and for styling, Tailwind CSS.

### Notes:

Since this was a homework assignment, I used JavaScript instead of TypeScript to get my work done faster. There is plenty of room for improvement, though I tried to complete the task within the deadline, to the best of my ability. The deadline was exactly 14 days.

The only library I used for my work was "js-cookies" for saving the "Name" field, which I chose to store instead of localstorage.

For example, I could have used Redux Toolkit for State management.

Thank you for the opportunity
